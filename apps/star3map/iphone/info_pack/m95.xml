	<information>
Messier 95 (also known as M95 or NGC 3351) is a barred spiral galaxy about 38 million light-years away in the constellation Leo. It was discovered by Pierre Méchain in 1781, and catalogued by Charles Messier four days later. On 16 March 2012, a supernova was discovered in M95.
The center of the galaxy contains a ring-shaped circumnuclear star-forming region with a diameter of approximately 2000 ly (600 pc).
M95 is one of several galaxies within the M96 Group, a group of galaxies in the constellation Leo. The group also includes the Messier objects M96 and M105.
A Type II supernova, designated as SN 2012aw, was discovered in M95 on 16 March 2012.
