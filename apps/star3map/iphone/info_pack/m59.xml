Messier 59 (also known as M59 or NGC 4621) is an elliptical galaxy in the constellation Virgo.
Messier 59 and the nearby elliptical galaxy Messier 60 were both discovered by Johann Gottfried Koehler in April 1779 during observations of a comet in the same part of the sky. Charles Messier listed both in the Messier Catalogue about three days after Koehler's discovery.
One supernova (1939B) has been recorded in M59; it reached a peak magnitude of 11.9.
Messier 59's core contains a supermassive black hole, with a mass that has been estimated to be 270 million times the mass of the Sun, and counter-rotates with respect of the rest of the galaxy, being bluer. This galaxy also has an inner disk of stars[8][9] and is very rich in globular clusters, with a population of them that has been estimated in around 2200.
M59 is a member of the Virgo Cluster
