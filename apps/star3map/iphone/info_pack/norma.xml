Norma is a small and inconspicuous constellation in the southern hemisphere between Scorpius and Centaurus. Its name is Latin for normal, referring to a right angle, and is variously considered to represent a rule, a carpenter's square, a set square or a level.

Norma, originally named l’Equerre et la Regle in French, was one of the constellations invented by Abbé de Lacaille in the middle of the 1750s, when he was measuring about 10,000 stars at the Cape of Good Hope. Norma represents a carpenter's square, used in the Age of Exploration by carpenters on exploratory vessels.
The Milky Way passes through Norma.
Norma has no α or β star. These are now officially part of Scorpius - N Sco and H Sco respectively. Norma's brightest star, γ2 Normae, is only of magnitude 4.0. Among the constellation's principal stars are the following:
Due to its location on the Milky Way, this constellation contains many deep-sky objects, the most notable of which is NGC 6087.
Coordinates: 16h 03m 00s, −52° 00′ 36″
