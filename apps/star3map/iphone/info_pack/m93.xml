Messier 93 (also known as M93 or NGC 2447) is an open cluster in the constellation Puppis. It was discovered by Charles Messier in 1781.
M93 is at a distance of about 3,600 light years from Earth and has a spatial radius of some 10 to 12 light years. Its age is estimated at some 100 million years.
Walter Scott Houston described its appearance as follows:
    Some observers mention the cluster as having the shape of a starfish. With a fair-sized telescope, this is its appearance on a dull night, but shows it as a typical star-studded galactic cluster.
