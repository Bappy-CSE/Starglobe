        Eta Canis Majoris (η Canis Majoris, abbreviated Eta CMa, η CMa), also named Aludra, is a star in the constellation of Canis Major. Since 1943, the spectrum of this star has served as one of the stable anchor points by which other stars are classified.
        
        Aludra shines brightly in the skies in spite of a large distance from Earth due to being intrinsically many times brighter (absolute magnitude) than the Sun. A blue-white supergiant of spectral type B5Ia, Aludra has a luminosity 176,000 times and a diameter around 80 times that of the Sun. Hohle and colleagues, using the parallax, extinction and analysis of spectrum, came up with a mass 19.19 times that and luminosity 105,442 times that of the Sun. It has only been around a fraction of the time the Sun has, yet is already in the last stages of its life. It is still expanding and may become a red supergiant, or perhaps has already passed that phase, but in either case it will become a supernova within the next few million years.
        
        Aludra is classified as an Alpha Cygni type variable star and its brightness varies from magnitude +2.38 to +2.48 over a period of 4.7 days.
