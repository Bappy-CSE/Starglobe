        Delta Sagittarii (δ Sagittarii, abbreviated Delta Sgr, δ Sgr), also named Kaus Media, is a double star[6] in the southern zodiac constellation of Sagittarius. The apparent visual magnitude of this star is +2.70, making it easily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements place the distance at roughly 348 light-years (107 parsecs) from the Sun.
        
        It bore the traditional names Kaus Media, Kaus Meridionalis, and Media, which derive from the Arabic قوس qaws 'bow' and Latin media 'middle'. In 2016, the International Astronomical Union organized a Working Group on Star Names (WGSN) to catalog and standardize proper names for stars. The WGSN's first bulletin of July 2016 included a table of the first two batches of names approved by the WGSN; which included Kaus Media for this star.
        
        In the catalogue of stars in the Calendarium of Al Achsasi al Mouakket, this star was designated Thani al Waridah, meaning 'second of Warida'.
        
        In Chinese, 箕 (Jī), meaning Winnowing Basket, refers to an asterism consisting of Delta Sagittarii, Gamma Sagittarii, Epsilon Sagittarii and Eta Sagittarii. Consequently, Delta Sagittarii itself is known as 箕宿二 (Jī Sù èr, English: the Second Star of Winnowing Basket.)
