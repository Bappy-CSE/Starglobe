Orbview 2 (SeaStar)was a spacecraft, developed by Orbital Sciences Corporation, to deliver daily, worldwide, high precision, moderate resolution, multispectral visible observations of ocean radiance for research in biogeochemical processes, climate change, and oceanography. Local high resolution (1 km) data (LAC) were delivered by direct broadcast at L-Band to regional scientific centers nationwide. Reduced resolution (4 km) data (GAC and selected LAC) were directly broadcast at S-band to smaller research centers and ships at sea. All reduced resolution data and selected full resolution data were recorded on board and transmitted to GSFC via daily dump at S-Band or via the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS). A minimum three year mission life was expected.
