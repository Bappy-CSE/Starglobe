	<information>
Messier 61 (also known as M61 or NGC 4303) is a barred spiral galaxy in the Virgo Cluster. It was discovered by Barnabus Oriani on May 5, 1779.
M61 is one of the largest members of Virgo, belonging to the subunit known as S Cloud
It has an Active galactic nucleus and it's classified as a starburst galaxy, with a candidate supermassive black hole with a mass around 5 million times that of our Sun on its center. This object is associated with a young, massive star cluster with a mass 100,000 times the one of the Sun, a radius of 3.1 parsecs and an age of 4 million years. Surrounding it, there's a nuclear spiral with a radius of 225 parsecs formed by several massive star-forming regions, that may be associated with a second bar much smaller than the main one of this galaxy.
Star formation is also high across M61's disk, perhaps due to interactions with her satellite galaxies NGC 4292 and NGC 4303B.
Unlike most late-type galaxies of the Virgo Cluster, M61 does not show a deficiency of neutral hydrogen
Six supernovae have been observed in this galaxy:
    SN 2008in
    SN 2006ov
    SN 1999gn
    SN 1964F
    SN 1961I
    SN 1926A
