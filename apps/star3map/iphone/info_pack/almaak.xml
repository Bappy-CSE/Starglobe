        Gamma Andromedae (γ Andromedae, abbreviated Gamma And, γ And) is the third brightest point of light in the constellation of Andromeda.
        
        In 1778, Johann Tobias Mayer discovered that γ Andromedae was a double star. When examined in a small telescope, it appears to be a bright, golden yellow star (γ1 Andromedae, also named Almach,) next to a dimmer, indigo blue star (γ2 Andromedae), separated by approximately 10 arcseconds. It is often considered by stargazers to be a beautiful double star with a striking contrast of color. It was later discovered that γ2 Andromedae is itself a triple star system. What appears as a single star to the naked eye is thus a quadruple star system, approximately 350 light-years from the Earth.
