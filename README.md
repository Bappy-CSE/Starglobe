Starglobe is a beautiful and intuitive stargazing app that uses your camera to precisely spot and identify celestial objects in sky, day or night. Find your favorite constellations as they fade in and out while you scan across the sky, locate the Moon, discover distant galaxies, and witness satellite fly-bys.

- Simple: Point your device at the sky to identify galaxies, stars, constellations and satellites (including the ISS and Hubble) passing overhead at your location.
- Augmented Reality (AR): Use your camera to spot objects in the sky, day or night.
- Huge stellar catalog: 111,000 stars, galaxies constellations and satellites!
- Get the facts on what you are looking at, including distance and brightness.
- Red night mode: Preserve your dark-adapted eyesight.
- Social: Capture and share beautiful images with friends and family on social networks. 
- Mobile: WiFi is NOT required (does not require a data signal or GPS to function). Take it camping, boating, or even flying!
